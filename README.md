# README-Generator

## What it is:

This is a simple README.md file generator using node

## How to use:

Using gitbash/the VS integrated terminal, the user can run the following code:

```
node index.html
```

The user will then be prompted to fill out several questions regarding their application. Once all questions have been answered, a README file will be automatically generated within the parent folder.
